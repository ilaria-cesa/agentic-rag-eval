"""Cross-encoder reranker (BAAI/bge-reranker-v2-m3).

A bi-encoder (bge-m3) embeds question and passage separately, which is fast but coarse. A
cross-encoder reads question and passage together and scores the pair, which is slower but much
better at telling near-duplicate passages apart. We use it only on a short list of candidates.
Imports are lazy so that the package works without torch (CI).
