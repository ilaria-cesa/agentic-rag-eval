"""Split extracted 10-K sections into overlapping, paragraph-aligned chunks.

Size is measured in characters (about 4 characters per token for English prose, so the
default of 1600 characters is roughly 400 tokens). The estimate is checked against the real
tokenizer on Colab; no model is needed to build chunks.

Design choices:
  * lines (paragraphs) are never cut in the middle unless a single line exceeds the maximum;
  * a chunk with less than `min_chars` of new content keeps absorbing lines, so it can exceed
    `max_chars` by up to `min_chars` (this avoids chunks made of a lone heading);
  * consecutive chunks share a small tail of whole lines, so an answer that straddles a
    boundary still appears fully in at least one chunk;
  * every chunk gets a context header (company, period, section) that is prepended only for
    embedding (`embed_text`), so the stored `text` stays clean for citation display.
